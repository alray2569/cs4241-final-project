WPI: A History
==============

An interactive visualization of the history of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute.  
To include the following, updating by decade:

* A map of the campus during that decade
* A picture of the president for most of that decade
* A description of what happened
* Various Statistics
  * Average class size
  * More TBD based on availability

The application will be navigable by a navbar at the top, or by using the arrow buttons
to move between consecutive decades. The map will be done using inline SVG, manipulated
by JavaScript. The statistics will be done using the D3 library. Research for the project
will be required to complete the project.
