		"main": "John Boynton was the idealistic owner of a tin manufactory. As he was uneducated, he was never accepted by the upper class, despite his wealth. In 1864, Boynton sent a letter to his cousin, David Whitcomb, describing his plan for a school of manufacturing and science, so that mechanics and manufacturers might be elevated to a higher social status. Meanwhile, Ichabod Washburn, the owner of a large wire mill, envisioned a school in which apprentices might learn technical skills.<br><br>By chance, the two men both confided their plans to one Seth Sweetser, and he became determined to bring the two men together in their ideas. At first, it was difficult to reconcile the two men's opinions, but eventually, Washburn agreed to sponsor and endow a department of practical mechanics with the stipulation that all students be required to blend theory in the classroom with practice in the shops.<br><br>Sweetser began to collect wealthy and influential people to sponsor the school.<br><br>The Worcester Free Institute of Industrial Science first opened to students in 1868, but neither Boynton nor Washburn lived to see it, having both died the previous year.",
		"life": "For the first thirty years of the school's history, there was only one course of study available to students, with the exception of the option of taking German or French as a senior. All students studied such subjects as theoretical mechanics, English language, chemistry, mechanical drawing, physics, geometry, algebra, freehand drawing, calculus, and French. Students of all grades were expected to spend about thirty-five hours a week in class and preparing for class. In accordance with the institute's principles of theory and practice, ten hours a week were set aside for &quot;practice&quot;, during which students would work in the lab doing chemistry, physics, and mechanical engineering work.<br><br>The school offered only a three-year course of study. Juniors, or first-year students, Middlers, or second-year students, and Seniors, or third-year students."

		"main": "In 1869, President Thompson proposed an idea for an apprentice class. Students would come for the second semester and work exclusively in the shops (with the exception of ten hours a week of mechanical drawing practice), producing goods for the school and paid at the rate of a dollar a day. These apprentices would be automatically accepted as juniors (first-year students) the following year without the necessity of entrance examinations. While not adopted that year, in February of 1870, seventeen apprentices were accepted for the first apprentice class at WPI.<br><br>As the size of the student population grew, the shops became increasingly unable to house them. For this reason, President Thompson suggested in 1873 that the that the Washburn Shops be expanded with another wing, but,, as the institute was in a financially precarious situation, the proposal was denied.",
		"life": "The apprentice class, along with other students, were expected to produce quality equipment, which the school could sell. They were, in effect, really apprentices of the school. Said President Thompson, &quot;A shop where second-rate work is done is not the place for boys to learn. The work produced [in the shop] will be the best of its kind.&quot; The instructors in the shops were experts in their fields, and insisted on thorough work in all respects.<br><br>Other students continued to follow the pattern set in place seven years earlier, studying chemistry, physics, mechanical engineering, technical drawing, and French for upwards of thirty hours a week.<br><br>Exceptional students and alumni were often sent to represent the school and its products at various fairs. In 1876, the school's exhibition that the Centenial Exposition in Philadelphia was given the highest award, and was reviewed favorably by various newspapers. Several pieces made by the school, including speed-lathes and model sets, were sold there."

	"1885": {
		"main": "The school's financial instability continued into the 1880's, as the income from the shops failed to cover its expenses. The shop director, Milton Higgins, came under heavy fire for losing money. However, after the lab began creating hydraulic elevators, and building them around the city of Worcester, the shop income rose to the same level as its expenses by the year 1882.<br><br>In 1880, David Whitcomb and Stephen Salisbury addressed the trustees concerning again the expansion of the Washburn Shops to better accomodate the student population, and offered to finance the project, since the school could not. The expansion to the building added 33 feet to each end of the building.",
		"life": "In 1876 began a new system of grading. Where formerly, half of the grade would be from practice and the other from examination, the new system allowed the professor to make remarks about students' efforts in their studies which would be counted as a quarter of the grade for a course. Competency and excellence were not sufficient for a student at the Worcester Free Institute, and one professor commented that a student &quot;didn't cut screws any better than six months ago&quot;, and gave a poor mark as a result. Tardiness and absence were not tolerated, and students who commited these offenses were required to submit a formal apology to the professor whose class they had missed, which would be added to the students' records. A student who accrued five absences was subject to suspension from the school.<br><br>Students' activities, even outside of classes, were closely monitored. In 1874, the school had banned unapproved student groups, called by the faculty &quot;secret societies,&quot; and in 1880, a student was expelled from the school for &quot;spending large portions of his nights smoking, drinking, and playing cards[...].&quot;"

		"life": "By 1895, the school had separated its students into five different courses of study: Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemistry, General Science, and Electrical Engineering. Students in these five programs would now take different courses based on their course of study, as well as using their practice time to do work in their respective fields. Students still did not have the freedom to set their own course load; indeed, they still could not even choose the schedule of their courses at all except in what course of study they chose to persue."
